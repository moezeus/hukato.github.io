I'm a [System Integration Engineer](https://formulatrix.com/careers/indonesia/rnd-sys-integration-eng/) (SIE) at Formulatrix Salatiga (PSL), specializing in [Cell Culture Automation](https://formulatrix.com/automated-cell-culture/) within the Mechanical Engineering division. My role is expanding from initial responsibilities in instrument-level testing/engineering QA, customer support, and documentation to the core function of translating user requirements into engineering specifications and timelines.

I'm actively contributing to this growth through: 1) supporting the implementation of a fair team grading/leveling structure; 2) leading the "protocol team" to define engineering requirements and timelines based on cell biologist needs; 3) refining calculation algorithms (planarity tolerance and tilting deck calculator) for improved usability; and 4) mentoring new team members to foster instrument knowledge and optimization skills.

My background, including a Master's in Instrumentation and Control with a focus on autonomous vehicle decision-making, underpins my strong interest in robotic systems and continuous learning. I also share this passion by mentoring students in IoT projects.  I'm always excited about the journey ahead in mastering robotics!
